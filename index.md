---------------------------------------------------------

  
The Yaesu FT-736R remains a popular satellite ground station transceiver.  However some modern computer software is not compatible with the CAT interface on the FT-736R.  Ham Radio Deluxe, in particular, does not support the FT-736R.  Ham Radio Deluxe does support the Yaesu FT-847 which has similar features.  We can solve this incompatibility by programming a CAT interface to present a FT-847 to the PC and emulate the new commands not supported on the FT-736R.  

Features not present on the FT-736R are ignored.  Memory channels are not supported and the radio must be set to VFO, also satellite mode must be set to VFO, before enabling CAT control of the radio.  1240 MHz is mapped to 240 MHz because the FT-847 does not have 4 MHz digits.

This is an assembled version of what will be available as a kit capable of operating multiple Yaesu models.

Have you thought about converting an old ATX power supply into a bench supply?  Your options are usually limited to drilling holes in the case or buying an expensive conversion kit with binding posts that still doesn't look very nice.  What you really need is just a simple box to hide all the wires with a place to mount connections, right? 

The HS-PWR-3 includes the parts for a triple output connection to your ATX supply with selectable voltage coaxial power jack.  You can wire this any way you like but our suggestion is to wire 3.3V, 5V, and 12V to the banana jacks and tie each of those to the 3-position switch feeding your coaxial power jack.  Also included is a separate ground lug that works with most wrist straps.  Your ATX supply should be grounded to the electrical ground and you can wire this lug directly to the chassis ground.
